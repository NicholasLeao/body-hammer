In the dark of the gym, we sweat and we toil
Our bodies aching, our muscles on boil
But we push through the pain, driven by a goal
To reshape our bodies and make them whole

Enter Body Hammer, our trusty companion
Tracking our workouts, our nutrition and more
Helping us reach for that fitness horizon
And smash through our goals, like never before

With Body Hammer, we are in control
Our progress on track, our path clear to see
We push harder, we strive for our goal
And with each step, we become stronger, more free

Body Hammer, our ally in this fight
Guiding us on, through each grueling night
Together, we'll hammer our bodies into shape
And emerge victorious, with strength and with grace.
